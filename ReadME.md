# ITGroup Tasks

This repository contains two programming tasks developed in Java. Below are the descriptions and instructions for each task:

## Task 1: Graphical Wind Turbine

### Description
Create/program a graphical wind turbine in Java programming language that rotates. Additionally, implement a setting option in a .txt file where the rotation speed can be adjusted between 1 (slow) and 10 (fast). The program should re-read the speed setting every 5-10 seconds.

### Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have JavaFX installed.
3. Extract the required libraries from the external library zip folder and add them to the project's classpath.
4. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
5. Locate the main class `azatha.WindTurbine` and run it.
6. The graphical wind turbine should be displayed, and it will rotate based on the speed setting.
7. Modify the speed setting in the .txt file as desired to adjust the rotation speed.

## Task 2: Continuous Mean Value Calculation

### Description
Create a program for continuous mean value calculation. The program should continuously prompt for input of floating-point numbers. After each input, it should calculate and display the mean value from all previously entered numbers, including the new input.

### Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred programming environment.
3. Review the code provided in the project's source files for the implementation details.
4. Run the program.
5. The program will continuously prompt for input of floating-point numbers.
6. After each input, the mean value will be calculated and displayed based on all previously entered numbers.
7. To end the program, enter "x" or use the provided "End" button.
